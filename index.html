				<div class="panel location__text">
				  <p>The terms location and place in geography are used to identify a point or an area on the Earth's surface or elsewhere. The term location generally implies a higher degree of certainty than place, the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of place identity and sense of place than on geometry.</p>

				<div class="accordion music"><img src="img/Headphones.png">Music</div>
				<div class="panel music__text">
				  <p>Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. In general definitions of music will include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>

				<div class="accordion notes"><img src="img/Lightbulb.png">Notes</div>
				<div class="panel notes__text">
				  <p>A note is a string of text placed at the bottom of a page in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text. The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or citations of a reference work in support of the text, or both.</p>

				<div class="accordion books"><img src="img/Bookmarks.png">Books</div>
				<div class="panel books__text">
				  <p>A book is both a usually portable physical object and the body of immaterial representations or intellectual object whose material signs—written or drawn lines or other two-dimensional media—the physical object contains or houses.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="accordion tendances"><img src="img/Lightning-Bolt.png">Tendances</div>
				<div class="panel tendances__text">
				  <p>A market trend is a perceived tendency of financial markets to move in a particular direction over time. These trends are classified as secular for long time frames, primary for medium time frames, and secondary for short time frames. Traders attempt to identify market trends using technical analysis, a framework which characterizes market trends as predictable price tendencies within the market when price reaches support and resistance levels, varying over time.</p>
